## Summary

Tilt the device to maneuver a marble through a randomly generated maze. The time required to get the marble to the exit is stored in a database for later display in a score summary screen. More difficult levels have larger mazes.

## Intended users

As a parent teaching my kid in this modern world, I want to enjoy a safe and fun library of engaging games for my child's development.

As a teacher continuously browsing options for my class, I would like to introduce modern versions of classic games for my class's recess.

    > As someone who enjoys randomness in my life, I need an app that lets me flip a virtual coin or roll one or more virtual dice, so that I can base my decisions on randomness, without having to carry coins or dice in my pockets.

## Functionality

* The game will feature tilt controls that can detect a device's motion.
* The game will feature a campaign of increasingly difficult levels challenging the user.
* The game will feature power up and game-altering effects.
* The game will have a High scoreboard and settings options.

## Persistent data
 
* Campaign Progress
* Saved settings
* Internal Clock

## Device/external services

* Mobile android device capable of detecting its own motions.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

* I would like for the game to feature a daily unlockable gained by opening the app every 24 hours.
* I would like to implement a mock storyline to get more practice with the code and to make the campaign more enjoyable.
